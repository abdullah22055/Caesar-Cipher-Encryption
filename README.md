# Caesar Cipher Program

This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar cipher in Python. The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a specified key. This project includes both encryption and decryption functionalities.

## How It Works

The Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a specified key. For example, with a key of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and 'C' becomes 'F'. This project helped me grasp fundamental concepts in cryptography.

### Example:

- **Plaintext**: "HELLO"
- **Key**: 3
- **Ciphertext**: "KHOOR"

This means each letter in "HELLO" is shifted by 3 positions to get "KHOOR".

## Features

- Encrypts plaintext using the Caesar cipher technique.
- Decrypts ciphertext back to the original plaintext.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Ignores non-alphabet characters.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher.git
   cd caesar-cipher
